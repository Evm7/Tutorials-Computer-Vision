# Tutorials-Computer-Vision
During my research I usually like to visuallize and understand clearly how some papers/models work. In this repository I will create some tutorials in Colab for repositories that I found dificult to understand how to use from their given code.


## Tracking-Detection
This approach consists on detecting objects in videos with a given identifier that is maintained during the whole video.-*   [Multi- Object Tracking Detection Tutorial](https://github.com/Evm7/Tutorials-Computer-Vision/blob/master/TrackingDetection_Tutorials/Multi_Object_TrackingDetection_Tutorial.ipynb): use of tracking-detection approach to detecting objects from images and videos and tracking their position through time. We make use of the most state-of-the-art obejct detectors with a real-time tracer for easy deployment to real world scenarios

## Hoi Interaction
In order to really understand the context of a given video, it is not only necessary to track and detect people, but to be able to undersatnd how these people interacts with the objects of the scene. Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detect this pairs of relationships between humans and objects and classifies the given task.
*   [QPIC Tutorial](https://github.com/Evm7/Tutorials-Computer-Vision/blob/master/HOI_Tutorials/QPIC.ipynb): original repository is [Query-Based Pairwise Human-Object Interaction Detection with Image-Wide Contextual Information](https://github.com/hitachi-rd-cv/qpic/tree/main)

## Eye Gaze Following
Detect what people is looking at allows to gain a lot of information regarding the scene and to predict intentions of humans.
*   [Gaze-Following Tutorial](https://github.com/Evm7/Tutorials-Computer-Vision/blob/master/EyeGaze_Tutorials/Gaze_Following_Tutorial.ipynb): original repository is [Detecting Attended Visual Targets in Video](https://github.com/ejcgt/attention-target-detection) for predicting where humans focuses and [Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch) for the tracking-detection of the faces through time.
