# Tutorials-Computer-Vision
During my research I usually like to visuallize and understand clearly how some papers/models work. In this repository I will create some tutorials in Colab for repositories that I found dificult to understand how to use from their given code.


## Hoi Interaction
*   [QPIC Tutorial](https://github.com/Evm7/Tutorials-Computer-Vision/blob/master/HOI_Tutorials/QPIC.ipynb): original repository is [Query-Based Pairwise Human-Object Interaction Detection with Image-Wide Contextual Information](https://github.com/hitachi-rd-cv/qpic/tree/main)
*   [Gaze-Following Tutorial](https://github.com/Evm7/Tutorials-Computer-Vision/blob/master/Gaze_Following_Tutorial_.ipynb): original repository is [Detecting Attended Visual Targets in Video](https://github.com/ejcgt/attention-target-detection) for predicting where humans focuses and [Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch) for the tracking-detection of the faces through time
